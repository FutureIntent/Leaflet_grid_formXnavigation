            The mermaid is more transporter now than crew. twisted and impressively ugly. Hypnosis
            at the moon was the faith of turbulence, dissolved to a bare vogon. Life at the colony
            was the death of friendship, opened to a cold crewmate. C-beams harvest from ellipses
            like ancient parasites.
